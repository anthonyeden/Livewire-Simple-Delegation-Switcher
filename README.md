# Livewire Simple Delegation Switcher

This application allows you to simply switch between different Livewire Sources (Inputs) and send them to a single Livewire Destination (Output). It's designed to be used as a simple studio delegation switcher.

You could use the PathfinderPC software. However, most small radio station's don't have the budget to buy this. If all you need to do is switch between a couple of different sources, Pathfinder can seem overkill.

This application relies on the Livewire Routing Protocol, so most Axia Livewire devices are supported.

This software has been developed by Anthony Eden (https://mediarealm.com.au/).

We make use of the following libraries:

* Livewire Routing Protocol Client - https://github.com/anthonyeden/Livewire-Routing-Protocol-Client
* Axia Livewire Stream Address Helper - https://github.com/anthonyeden/Axia-Livewire-Stream-Address-Helper
